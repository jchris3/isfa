						<div class="promo">
								<p>
								  For more than fifteen years, we have provided vocational trainings at ODECI in the following main specialties: Customs & Transit, Transport & Logistics, Computerized Accounting & Management.
								  We were struck by the large number of young people who choose vocational training instead of continuing their studies in higher education, after obtaining their baccalauréat or their GCE Advanced Level.
								  This could be analyzed as school drop-out. That is why we decided to offer these young people who come to us,
								  the opportunity of pursuing the same qualifications in higher education.
								</p>
								<p>
								 It is in this context that the idea of  creation of the Higher Institute of Applied Training (ISFA) was born and is a reality today.
								</p>
								<p>
								   At ISFA, young baccalauréat/GCE A’L holders will be able not only to learn a trade but also to continue their academic studies. 
								   The future baccalauréat/GCE A’L holders and other students will therefore find at ISFA,
								   an accurate response to their concerns of professional insertion.

						<div class="promo">
							<div class="promo">
								<p>
								 <strong>ISFA wants to be for companies what ENAM is for the Government.</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
								After more than twenty years at the service of the Cameroon customs Administration, 
								my personal experience has made me increasingly observe a serious technical imbalance in the exchanges between the customs staff and its various users. 
								</p>
								<p>
								 Just as the executives of this Administration trained at the National School of Administration and Magistracy (ENAM) show a strong intellectual and professional background, the customs clearing and forwarding agents, the representatives of economic operators exhibit their approximate knowledge. This technical deficit is, more often the cause of multiple inconveniences that <strong>lead</strong> economic operators to waste a lot of time and money.
								</p>
								<p>
								 By positioning itself as a reference for customs matters, ISFA intends to adjust this imbalance by becoming for companies what ENAM is for the Government. 
								 Its objective is therefore to train, by a skillful mix between theory and practice, 
								 executives capable of controlling and making a proper application of customs regulations and defending the interests of economic operators during customs clearance operations.

						<h3 class="h3_promo" >An Institute at the service of the Insurance sector.</h3>
						<div class="promo">
								<p>
								 The insurance sector in Cameroon is performed by twenty-four (24) companies, sixteen (16) of which are in the Property and Casualty Insurance segment and eight (08) in the Life Insurance segment. 
								 These companies are supported in their production and claims management by a range of SMEs composed of agents and brokers.
								</p>
								<p>
								  In the last two financial years, for example, this sector has recorded a total production of 182.2 billion FCFA in 2015 against 161.32 billion FCFA in 2014,
								  that is, an increase of 12.94%. This growth, which is not an epiphenomenon, testifies the vitality of the market.
								</p>
								<p>
								  To achieve and maintain this production, companies, insurance agents and brokers need well-trained executives,
								  supervisors and junior staff. Trainings in this area have always been largely carried-out by the Institut International d’Assurance (IIA) of Yaoundé,
								  which has positioned itself as the reference institution for trainings in insurance.
								</p>
								<p>
								  Considering the vitality of the insurance market in Cameroon,
								  the need for skilled personnel is clearly increasing and the IIA alone can no longer cover this need.
								  It is in the framework of this context and with the same objectives that the Higher Institute of Applied Training (ISFA) in Douala has opened the specialty ‘insurance” 
								  to provide a training of at least an equivalent standard to the one provided at the IIA in Yaoundé.
								</p>
								<p>
								  Through a skillful mix of lecturers from the university milieu and those from the professional world, 
								  national as well as international, ISFA intends to take on the challenge of bringing to the market, 
								  young graduates of very high competencies, capable of being self-employed, 
								  taking responsibilities at junior and senior management positions in various companies in Cameroon.

						<h3 class="h3_promo" >An Institute bound to the new job requirements in logistics and transport</h3>
						<div class="promo">
								<p>
								Despite the importance of logistics and transport for companies, these businesses have long been relegated to the background or embedded in other services for some; and for others, reserved for low-skilled profiles, 
								the latter not perceiving the interest of making them full occupations. 
								Yet companies can meet the challenge of competitiveness in such a competitive world by controlling the costs associated with these services.
								</p>
								<p>
								Today, globalization and the development of NICTs have generated new techniques for the exchange of goods and services based on predictability, organization and celerity. 
								Although these new techniques are more used start-ups, they will soon colonize commercial and industrial enterprises. These methods, which call for greater technicality, will deeply modify the management mode of the companies in terms of and logistics transport,
								while interacting at the same time the customer-supplier relationship.
								</p>
								<p>
								To support the upgrading of the logistics and transport sector, 
								ISFA is positioning itself as the Institute that will train the skilled professionals needed by companies.

								<h4><strong></strong></h4>
								<p>
									The international trade supply chain constitutes a sphere with specific domain of activities that are inter-related. 
									Every actor in the various domains must require and possess specific and quality competences in order to excel and carry out their activities in a way that provides effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.
								</p>
								<p>
									As such, a varying number of institutions provide teaching and learning facilities whose output boils down to qualified professionals in the various specific domain of activity. 
									<br>
								</p>
								<p>
									Providing quality training for international trade experts in specific domain of activities such as Customs brokerage, Logistics and Transport, Taxation assistants, etc.
									has been the predilection of the vocational centre ODECI  which has trained since 2000 and put
									in the job market about 3,000 technicians who successfully earned their certificates of the afore mentioned specific domain of activities.<br> 
								</p>
								<p>
									Today, ODECI decides to move forward with the putting in place of an institute of higher learning in specific domain of activities mentioned earlier, the HND.
									ODECI is now an accredited training institute that will henceforth,
									provide besides the certification program that runs for 10 months, equally offer an HND program that runs for 2 years.<br>
								</p>
								<p>	
									I can assure you, quality teaching in a higher learning institute like ISFA (Institut Supérieur des Formations Appliquées),
									matters for student learning outcomes. But fostering quality teaching presents higher learning institutions with a range of challenges at a time when the higher education sector is coming under pressure from many different directions.
									Institutions need to ensure that the education they offer meets the expectations of students and the requirements of employers, 
									both today and for the future. <br>
								</p>
								<p>
									Students who are going to make this important decision to seek admission into ISFA shall be comforted by the blend of a satisfactory
									training they’ll acquire by the end of their training coupled with a highly qualified and experienced 
									professionals from whom students shall reap the best of lectures any such institute can offer. <br>
								</p>
								<p>
									ISFA is a complex organisation where the institution-wide vision and strategy is well-aligned with bottom-up practices and innovations in teaching and learning. 
									ISFA has been designed as an effective learning platform, where excellent pedagogical practices are developed and shared. <br>
								</p>
								<p>
									As ISFA invites students to enrol massively for the HND program in the various specialties, 
									it engages in fostering quality training essentially for the following reasons:<br>
									<ol>
										<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	To respond to the growing demand for meaningful and relevant teaching. Students as well as employers want to ensure that the training will lead to gainful employment and will equip them with the skills needed to evolve professionally over a lifetime. </li>
										<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	To demonstrate that they are reliable providers of good quality higher training, while operating in a competitive environment, with multiple stakeholders, each with their own expectations (licenced Brokers or clearing houses, Transit agencies, 
										logistics and transportation agencies, Taxation assistant service providers, local authorities and other employers…etc). 
										</li>
										<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	To increasingly broaden the scope of the training and provide a greater diversity of student profiles</li>
										<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.	To respond to the increased pressures of global competition and economic efficiency  </li>
										<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.	To respond to the need of producing a skilled workforce to meet the challenges of the 21st century  </li>
									</ol>
